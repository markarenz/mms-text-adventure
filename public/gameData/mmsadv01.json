        "introText": "In the summer of '78, the Caperville Mall is the place to be! Grab a slice and cup of Lemon Brutus in our award-winning food court. Take a stroll through aisle after aisle of parachute pants at L'GÃªnant. Crack a book or two at Wormwood Booksellers, then relax in the fancy massage chairs at The Shopper Image. [cue jingle] You can have it all... at the Caperville Mall!",
        "gameWonMessage": "Hurray! Sure, the effort required to reverse engineer the chemical from this tiny sample and produce enough to cure thousands of residents is going to be a massive pain, but that's happening outside the scope of this story, so who really cares? For the sake of wrapping things up, I'll just say that with the antidote in our hands, the town's future is once again secure. All thanks to me- I mean you- I mean us. Together we have completed this adventure. I hope you're proud of yourself.",
