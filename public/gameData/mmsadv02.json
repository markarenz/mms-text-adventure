        "introText": "It was all a big myth-take...\n\nLocal bigwig Mr. Zee has bulldozed the hilltop to make way for a gated community, O Mountain Estates, leaving everyone else to eke out a living down here in a depressing little village affectionately known as Squalor Holler. Saving the town will mean defeating Zee at his own game, but judging by the lightning bolt he carries around with him everywhere, I don't think butting heads with him is a good idea.\n\nI will be your avatar in this world. I am new in town, so I won't be much help in explaining what's going on. We need to talk to people here to make things happen. If you know a character has info we need, try a command like SAY HI or SAY another character's name to trigger further dialogue or other events.",
        "gameWonMessage": "Zee has followed me here, panting and wheezing as I hold the lightning bolt over the fountain threatening to destroy it. \"No! Stop!\" shouts Zee, pleading. \"OK, I admit it! Yes, the gated community project was just an excuse to drown the town in raw sewage. Yes, it's a failure and out of cash. I would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for those meddling gods.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah\" says Theena in sudden realization. \"I suppose we are gods. We used to live up on that hill together. It's all coming back to me now.\"\n\n\"Oh, that,\" said Zee sheepishly. \"A while back, I put something in the water supply to get you to forget who you are, and I think it's wearing off.\"\n\nZee then quickly fled, closely pursued by a pack of pitchfork-wielding O Mountain investors. In the hours that followed, the residents of Squalor Holler (soon to be renamed something slightly less degrading) held an informal election to decide the town's new post-Zee leadership. Folks chose Jerry for town marshal and Paulo for tourism director. Dion, now sober as a judge, accepted the role of judge, and Theena became the new mayor with a fancy sash and everything.\n\nThings are shaping up well enough here that I may just stick around in Squalor Holler. You can go on and play some other game. Go on, now. Git!",

        "120": "\"I don't want to talk to anyone,\" says Festus. He seems angry but also sad and confused. Ditey was out of Festus' league, but there's no point in mentioning that now. \"What I want is a way to get revenge on my ex, Ditey. Something smelly like a fish that I can stick under her radiator. You got anything like that?\"",
        "121": "\"Yeah, thanks,\" he says. \"Now that I thought about it for a bit, revenge is a bad idea. Maybe I'll use the fish to cook her dinner.\" Festus wipes the liquids from his face and nose. \"You seem like a good person. Tell you what- I'll make you something for free. Bring me the materials and I can make you something useful. Here's an example of my work, a pair of heavy-duty shears.\" He hands me the shears and goes back to work.",

        "123": "\"Ah, OK. I know just what I can do with all of this,\" he says excitedly. After a half hour of hammering and muttering, Festus completes the project: a perfectly functional compass.",

        "125": "\"I'm going to send you on an epic quest,\" says Dion, his eyes half closed. \"I require the Golden Fleece. I lost it somewhere in the labyrinth, and I'm getting chilly. Please find it for me.\" He then returns to his pastime of muttering to himself.",
        "126": "\"Excellent work, young adventurer,\" says Dion as he pulls his arms through the sleeves. \"Ah, that's better. I'm not sure what you can do with this but I nicked this from Theena's back when she had a dance floor in that bar of hers.\" Dion hands me a shiny mirrored disco ball.",

        "129": "\"I am not her biggest fan.\"",
        "130": "\"Labyrinth is just a fancy word for maze. People go in and they don't come out. Folks say they get eaten by the minotaur, but really he's a sweetheart. Just SAY HI and he'll drop the monster act.\"",
        "131": "\"New in town?\" asks Theena. I nod. \"I can tell because you're not dead-eyed like the rest of us. Give it time, though. You'll catch on. In my line of work, I have the dirt on just about everyone, so just ask. For example, to ask about Zee, just SAY ZEE.\"",

        "134": "\"Howdy, adventurer!\"",
        "135": "\"I knew he was up to something nasty on O Mountain. To take him down, we need to steal the source of his power: his lightning bolt.\"",
        "136": "\"I am not her biggest fan. She has something of mine, an apple.\"",
        "137": "\"Oh, it's only the most magnificent object in the world. To see it is to covet it completely. Also, stealing it would get Chera all cheesed off, so go steal it for me.\"",

        "139": "\"The fame has gone to his head, you know, and he's not all there if you know what I mean. He's been sitting out in the sun too long. The guy is going to turn himself into a raisin if he's not careful.\"",

        "144": "\"He's not doing so well, I guess. He started day drinking a while back, and I should probably cut him off but he's my best customer.\"",
        "145": "\"I don't know what to say.\"",
        "146": "\"Welcome to the Marina! If you want to enjoy the Jetski, you'll need two things: a personal floatation device or PFD and you need attend my safety briefing.\"",

But check it out- it's a mess now because my fans are all over the place, and they don't know what a trash can is for, I guess. Can you go over there and bring me trash you find. Four pieces of trash should do it. I'd take care of this myself, but we both know I'm too famous for that. Hey, if anyone gives you trouble over there, use this.\" He clips off a lock of his hair, puts it in a small plastic baggie and hands it to me.",

        "156": "\"Soldier!\" shouts Reeze, inches from my face. \"In our battle against the encroaching menace of Zee and his minions, we must become self-sufficient if we want to survive! I can only assume that by now the world above ground has descended into a nightmare of radiation and communism.
